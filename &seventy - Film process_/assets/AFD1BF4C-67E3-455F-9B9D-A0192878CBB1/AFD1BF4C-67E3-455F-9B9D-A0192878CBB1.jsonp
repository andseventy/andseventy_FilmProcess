Still Image Completion: The initial stage involves finalising still images, laying the foundation for the subsequent steps.\\u2028\\u20282. Written Treatment: Following the still images, we embark on pre-production. This phase involves crafting a written treatment, where we conceptualize various ideas for the film. Drawing inspiration from elements such as the brand identity, architectural design philosophy, surrounding environment, and community, we determine which aspects will be featured in the film and establish their significance. Subsequently, we intricately integrate these elements to create a memorable film that effectively communicates our ideas. We usually present 2 or 3 different concepts.\\u2028\\u20283. Storyboard and Animatic: Once a concept is selected, we proceed to create a storyboard and animatic. This step involves outlining the framework of the film, incorporating reference images and placeholder music to visualise it’s flow. Initial 3D renders serve as rough drafts to further develop the film's structure.","targetRectangle":{"y":323.87899780273438,"x":104.04773712158203,"width":763.86336000000006,"height":608}},{"text":"4. Offline Edit: In the fourth phase, we conduct the offline edit, assembling all elements in their near-final form. At this stage, the film reaches approximately 90% completion, providing a comprehensive overview of its content and structure.\\u2028\\u20285. Colour Grade and Music\/Sound Mix: The final step involves enhancing the film through colour grading and refining the music and sound mix. This process adds the finishing touches, ensuring a polished and cohesive final product.","targetRectangle":{"y":323.87899781214111,"x":964.79128795617987,"width":740.73600000000044,"height":350.99999999999994}},{"text":"￼","targetRectangle":{"y":1016.8547360897064,"x":1865.4063244628906,"width":8.8400000000001455,"height":24}},{"text":"Film process ","targetRectangle":{"y":100.10768127441406,"x":100.0477294921875,"width":415.73500000000013,"height":103}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.00035007912466775983,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"52C9719EA65B23EF5181848E02F36829"}]}]}}]}} )
